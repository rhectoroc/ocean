Gallery now displays correctly with full 3D ring effect and parallax backgrounds.
2026-02-04 [CRITICAL FIX] Removed global CSS rule `div { position: absolute; }` from ParallaxGallery.css that was breaking entire page layout. Applied position: absolute only to specific gallery elements (#parallax-dragger, #parallax-ring, .parallax-img, .parallax-vignette). Page layout restored.
